# osage — Clustered Layout Examples

Examples in this directory use Graphviz’s **osage** engine, which is designed for clustered, partitioned, or grid‑like layouts where nodes are grouped into visually distinct regions.

Official Graphviz documentation:  
https://graphviz.org/docs/layouts/osage/

## What’s Here
- Self‑contained Relationship Visualizer workbooks  
- Sample data and SQL queries  
- Resulting Graphviz outputs (SVG/PNG)  
- Brief notes explaining each example  

Included examples:
- [**the-beatles-album-releases-by-year**](./the-beatles-album-releases-by-year/) — Album releases by The Beatles (1963–1970), clustered by year and canonical album, with each node styled using the album cover.  
- [**kanban**](./kanban/) — A Kanban Board with nodes clustered by status, with each work type styled in a unique color.
