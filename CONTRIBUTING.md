# Contributing to Excel to Graphviz Examples

Thank you for your interest in contributing. This repository grows stronger with clear examples, well‑designed datasets, and practical modeling patterns that help others get more out of the Relationship Visualizer.

## What You Can Contribute

Contributions of all sizes are welcome, including:

- New example workbooks that demonstrate a specific modeling pattern  
- Improvements to existing examples (clarity, structure, SQL refinements)  
- Additional Graphviz styling techniques  
- Better explanations or mini‑README updates  
- Synthetic datasets that illustrate real‑world scenarios  
- Bug fixes or corrections in documentation  

If your contribution helps others understand how to turn Excel data into meaningful Graphviz diagrams, it belongs here.

## Contribution Guidelines

To keep the repository consistent and easy to navigate:

- Place each new example in the appropriate **layout engine folder**  
- Include a short **mini‑README** explaining the scenario and what the example demonstrates  
- Use **clear, minimal datasets** that focus on the modeling pattern  
- Prefer **SQL that is easy to read and adapt**  
- Keep Graphviz styling simple unless the example is specifically about styling  
- Avoid proprietary or sensitive real‑world data — synthetic examples only  

If you’re unsure where something fits, open an issue and we’ll figure it out together.

## How to Submit a Contribution

1. Fork the repository  
2. Create a new branch for your contribution  
3. Add your example, dataset, or documentation update  
4. Commit with a clear message  
5. Open a pull request describing what you added and why  

Pull requests don’t need to be perfect — clarity and usefulness matter more than polish.
