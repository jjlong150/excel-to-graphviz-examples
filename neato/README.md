# neato — Force‑Directed Layout Examples

Examples in this directory use Graphviz’s **neato** engine, which produces force‑directed layouts for graphs that are not strictly hierarchical.

Official Graphviz documentation:  
https://graphviz.org/docs/layouts/neato/

## What’s Here
- Self‑contained Relationship Visualizer workbooks  
- Sample data and SQL queries  
- Resulting Graphviz outputs (SVG/PNG)  
- Brief notes explaining each example  

Included examples:
- [**rock-band-musician-connections**](./rock-band-musician-connections/) — A force‑directed graph of more than 100 rock bands, showing how they are connected through shared musicians in their key lineups.

## When to Use neato
Use these examples when you need:
- Undirected or loosely structured networks  
- Relationship maps without a clear parent/child hierarchy  
- Influence or proximity diagrams  
- Layouts where spacing and clustering emerge naturally from the data
